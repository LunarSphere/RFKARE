## What it does
Arena Aligner helps cities to grow in wealth and culture by identifying how they can expand into the world of sports. It starts by identifying the optimal location in a city to build an NFL football stadium, then leverages modern technology to provide insights into why the location is optimal. It then tells the story of how a new sports arena could enhance the city's culture by creating a team that reflects the city's unique spirit. It also will explore the financial insights of the stadium and how it could help bring in income for the city through various sporting and community events. 

## How we built it
The core of Arena Aligner is the optimization function, which finds the best place in a city to place a new sports stadium by considering various factors, which are mainly extracted from aerial image data. We developed this model by first brainstorming different factors that could impact a location's ability to sustain a sports arena. INSERT MORE TECHNICAL DETAILS. As a final touch on the project, we used multiple generative AI models, including a vision language model, to provide details and insights about the value that building a stadium at the suggest location can bring to the city.

## What's next for Arena Aligner
The amazing aspect of Arena Aligner is that it can be easily adapted to various different scenarios. For instance, it can be applied to any city in the United States or abroad. It can also be used to find spots for other kinds of venues, such as ones for different sports or even events such as concerts. Given more time and resources, we could enhance Arena Aligner by accounting for even more features, allowing for a more optimal location suggestion.
